# Lab 12: Terraform CI/CD on Azure with GitHub Actions

## 6. Create the GitHub Actions workflows

### 6.3 Terraform deploy

The third workflow will deploy the Terraform configuration to Azure. This workflow will be triggered on a merge to the main branch from a pull-request.

Update the GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder called `infra-ci-cd.yml`. Add the following content to the bottom of the file.

```yaml
# This will only run if the terraform plan has changes, and when the PR is approved and merged to main.
  terraform-apply:
    name: 'Terraform Apply'
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && needs.terraform-plan.outputs.tfplanExitCode == 2
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    needs: [terraform-plan]
    
    steps:
    # Checkout the repository to the GitHub Actions runner
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Install the latest version of Terraform CLI and configure the Terraform CLI configuration file with a Terraform Cloud user API token
    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3

    # Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory by creating initial files, loading any remote state, downloading modules, etc.
    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init

    # Download saved plan from artifacts  
    - name: Download Terraform Plan
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: tfplan

    # Terraform Apply
    - name: Terraform Apply
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

</details>

This workflow will only run if the terraform plan has changes, and when the PR is approved and merged to main. The workflow will use the production environment, and therefore the Azure clientID with read/write permission. The workflow will depend on the `terraform-plan` job to complete successfully.
