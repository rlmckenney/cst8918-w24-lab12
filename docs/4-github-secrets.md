# Lab 12: Terraform CI/CD on Azure with GitHub Actions

Your GitHub Actions workflows will access Azure resources using OpenID Connect (OIDC). This means that your workflows authenticate directly to Azure, and that there is no need to store credentials as long-lived secrets which provides security benefits. 

For more information, see [About security hardening with OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).

## 4. GitHub Secrets
GitHub allows you to store a common set of values (variables or secrets) that can be used in your workflows. These secrets are encrypted and can be used in your workflows to authenticate with external services, or to store sensitive information. Values set at the repository level are available to all workflows in the repository. Values set at the environment level are available only to workflows in the environment and will override repository level values with the same name.

### Repository level secrets
Create four secrets at the repository level. These will be the default values used by  GitHub Actions workflows to authenticate with Azure.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` - the `id` of your Azure AD Tenant
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - the `id` of your Azure subscription within that tenant
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` - the `appId` of the Azure AD application with the `reader` role
- `ARM_ACCESS_KEY` - the `primary_access_key` of the Azure Storage Account that stores the Terraform state file

See the [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) documentation for more information and instructions for creating them.

### Environment level secrets
In the `production` environment, create a secret for the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` of the Azure AD application with the `contributor` role. This will allow the `production` environment to deploy the infrastructure and application to Azure.
